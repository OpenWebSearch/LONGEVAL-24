Quantum annealers can better explore complex optimization landscapes than . the problem formulation that we build is, due to the bootstrapping, highly inconsistent/contradictory. Hence, we explore quantom annealers, comparing them with simulated annealing, finding that xy. QuantumCLEF: Feature Selection for Bootstrapped Feature Importance.
