Bootstrapping for feature selection was already used before~\cite{yuan:99}, but not in IR/LTR.


Hello world example~\cite{yuan:99}: Add forgery features that are not relevant to the pool. Try to reduce them. I cann add those features in any distribution, normal distribution, etc. E.g., I should be able to fool every feature selection that does not incorporate the true relevance label.
